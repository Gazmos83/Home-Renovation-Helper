## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Approval is shown and set from the Studio
The Studio SHALL show, on the Pieces page for each version and in a conversation's project panel for the bound piece, whether a version is approved, and SHALL let the owner approve a built version and unapprove an approved one there. The control SHALL be offered only for a version whose build succeeded; an API refusal SHALL be shown next to the version it names. After a change the page and the panel SHALL show the new state without a reload. Neither SHALL show a model name, prompt, token count or cost. The approve and unapprove flow SHALL pass a recorded browser check before it counts as done.

#### Scenario: Approve from the Pieces page
- **WHEN** the owner opens `listening-wall` on the Pieces page and approves version 4
- **THEN** version 4 shows "Approved" and a reload shows the same

#### Scenario: Approval in the project panel
- **WHEN** the conversation is bound to `listening-wall`, version 4 is approved and version 5 is the latest
- **THEN** the project panel shows version 5 as latest and version 4 as approved, with a control to approve version 5 once it is built

#### Scenario: Unapprove
- **WHEN** the owner unapproves version 4 from the panel
- **THEN** the panel and the Pieces page show no approved version
