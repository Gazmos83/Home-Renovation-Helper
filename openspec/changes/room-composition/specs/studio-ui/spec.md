## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The Rooms page shows compositions and the model library
The Studio SHALL have a Rooms page for the owner, with two parts.

**Compositions.** For each composition the page SHALL show:
- its scope, its latest version and that version's build status;
- its items by name and type, with each piece's version and approval state ("no longer approved" shown plainly);
- the latest screenshot or still, and a link to the viewer when a turntable exists.

**Model library.** The page SHALL show the library with each model's name, stated size and check state (`checking`, `ready`, or `refused` with its reason). It SHALL offer an upload form taking a file, a name and the three dimensions, and a delete action. A refused upload or delete SHALL show its reason next to the form.

The page SHALL NOT show model names of language models, prompts, token counts or costs. The page SHALL pass a recorded browser check before it counts as done.

#### Scenario: Unapproved piece shown
- **WHEN** a composition places a piece version that has since been unapproved
- **THEN** the Rooms page lists that item with "no longer approved" beside it

#### Scenario: Upload refused
- **WHEN** the owner uploads a `.blend` file
- **THEN** the page shows the refusal reason and the library is unchanged

#### Scenario: Check finishes
- **WHEN** an uploaded model's check finishes while the page is open
- **THEN** its state changes from `checking` to `ready` without a reload
