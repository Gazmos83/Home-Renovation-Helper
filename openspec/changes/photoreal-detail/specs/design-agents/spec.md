## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The Foreman routes each turn to one specialist
Each turn SHALL be handled by exactly one specialist (Intake, Designer, Builder, Researcher, Reviewer or Lighting & materials), chosen by the Foreman from the conversation and the house file. Application rules bound the choice:
- The Builder is never chosen when the thread has no bound piece with a built version.
- The Reviewer is never chosen unless the bound piece's latest version has a screenshot or a render.
- Lighting & materials is never chosen unless the bound piece's latest version has a successful build.
- A thread with no piece and no confirmed brief goes to Intake, unless the owner asks a question the Researcher answers (a price, a product, a guideline).
- The Researcher prices only a bound piece's version.

A pending confirmation SHALL resume in the specialist that raised it. The owner never names a specialist and a message cannot force one.

#### Scenario: New wish
- **WHEN** a thread has no piece and the owner describes what they want
- **THEN** Intake answers

#### Scenario: No piece, render asked
- **WHEN** a thread has no piece and the owner asks for a turntable
- **THEN** Intake or the Designer answers, explaining what must exist first; the Builder is not chosen

#### Scenario: Price question
- **WHEN** a thread's piece has a version and the owner asks what the boards will cost
- **THEN** the Researcher answers with a pricing of that version

#### Scenario: Review asked with nothing rendered
- **WHEN** the bound piece's latest version has no screenshot or render and the owner asks for a check
- **THEN** the Reviewer is not chosen and the reply says what must exist first

#### Scenario: Photoreal detail asked on a built piece
- **WHEN** the bound piece's latest version is built and the owner asks for realistic oak and soft lighting
- **THEN** Lighting & materials answers

#### Scenario: Photoreal detail asked with nothing built
- **WHEN** the bound piece has no built version and the owner asks for photoreal detail
- **THEN** Lighting & materials is not chosen and the reply says the piece must be built first

### Requirement: Each specialist runs on its routed model with its instruction file
Each specialist SHALL call the model routed for its slot (`intake`, `designer`, `builder`, `researcher`, `reviewer`, `lighting`; the Foreman on `foreman`) with that slot's generation profile. It SHALL be prompted from its checked-in instruction file: a header naming its tools (not editable) and text, followed by the fixed notes and the untrusted-content guard composed by code, exactly once and last. The tools a header may name SHALL be the tools the plugin manifests declare. A specialist SHALL bind only the named tools whose plugin is enabled for the thread, plus enabled HTTPS plugins for its role. A missing or malformed instruction file SHALL stop startup naming the file.

#### Scenario: Prompt shape
- **WHEN** the Designer's prompt is assembled
- **THEN** it ends with the untrusted-content guard, contains it once, and binds exactly the tools its header names that are enabled for the thread

#### Scenario: Instruction file missing
- **WHEN** `reviewer.md` is absent
- **THEN** startup fails naming `reviewer.md`

#### Scenario: Header names an undeclared tool
- **WHEN** `designer.md` names a tool no manifest declares
- **THEN** startup fails naming `designer.md` and the tool

#### Scenario: Lighting on its slot
- **WHEN** the Lighting & materials specialist answers a turn
- **THEN** the call uses the model routed for `lighting` and binds only the detail-pass tools enabled for the thread
