## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The Foreman routes each turn to one specialist
Each turn SHALL be handled by exactly one specialist (Intake, Designer, Builder, Researcher, Reviewer or Lighting & materials), chosen by the Foreman from the conversation and the house file, or answered by the Foreman with one of its two fixed questions below. Application rules bound the choice, in this order:
- A question the Researcher answers (a price, a product, a guideline) goes to the Researcher, with or without a confirmed room.
- When the owner's message, or the reply just before it, names two or more builds of the conversation by package id or name, the Foreman SHALL answer "Which piece do you mean?" listing those builds, and no specialist runs.
- While the conversation has no confirmed room or apartment, a turn that carries a plan or photo, names a room or apartment of the house file, or answers the Foreman's room question goes to Intake. Any other turn, including one that carries a design file, SHALL be answered by the Foreman with "Which room is this for?", and no specialist runs.
- Once the conversation has a confirmed room or apartment, a turn that carries a design file goes to the Designer, whatever else the thread holds. A design file sent before the room was confirmed is not imported then; the owner attaches it again once the room is confirmed.
- When the active build has no room, or a room outside the conversation's confirmed room or apartment, a turn the Foreman gave to the Designer, Builder, Reviewer or Lighting & materials goes to Intake, which confirms the room for that build.
- The Builder is never chosen when the thread has no bound piece with a built version.
- The Reviewer is never chosen unless the bound piece's latest version has a screenshot or a render.
- Lighting & materials is never chosen unless the bound piece's latest version has a successful build.
- A thread with no piece and no confirmed brief goes to Intake, unless the owner asks to compose a room while the conversation has a confirmed room, or while the house file holds an approved piece version or a composition in the conversation's room or apartment (the Designer). A confirmed room is enough because a room may be composed with no items.
- A thread with no piece and no confirmed brief SHALL also go to the Designer when the Foreman chose the Designer and the owner's message, or the reply just before it, names a piece in the house file by its package id or its name. This is so that the piece can be revised, rebuilt or given an imported version. A named piece that is not yet one of the conversation's builds joins them and becomes the active build.
- The Researcher prices only a bound piece's version.

The two fixed questions SHALL be composed by the application, SHALL NOT need a model call, and SHALL be added to the thread's history as the reply. A pending confirmation SHALL resume in the specialist that raised it. The owner never names a specialist and a message cannot force one.

- **THEN** Intake answers

#### Scenario: No piece, render asked
- **WHEN** a thread has a confirmed room and no piece and the owner asks for a turntable
- **THEN** Intake or the Designer answers, explaining what must exist first; the Builder is not chosen

#### Scenario: Price question
- **WHEN** a thread's piece has a version and the owner asks what the boards will cost
- **THEN** the Researcher answers with a pricing of that version

#### Scenario: Price question without a room
- **WHEN** a conversation has no confirmed room and the owner asks what an oak board costs at toom
- **THEN** the Researcher answers

#### Scenario: Review asked with nothing rendered
- **WHEN** the bound piece's latest version has no screenshot or render and the owner asks for a check
- **THEN** the Reviewer is not chosen and the reply says what must exist first

#### Scenario: Photoreal detail asked on a built piece
- **WHEN** the bound piece's latest version is built, it is in the conversation's room, and the owner asks for realistic oak and soft lighting
- **THEN** Lighting & materials answers

#### Scenario: Photoreal detail asked with nothing built
- **WHEN** the bound piece has no built version and the owner asks for photoreal detail
- **THEN** Lighting & materials is not chosen and the reply says the piece must be built first

#### Scenario: Design attached in a new thread
- **WHEN** a thread has no piece, no brief and no confirmed room, and the owner sends "import this" with a design file attached
- **THEN** the reply is "Which room is this for?", no specialist runs, and nothing is imported

#### Scenario: Design attached after the room is confirmed
- **WHEN** a thread has no piece and no brief, its confirmed room is `Hall`, and the owner sends "import this" with a design file attached
- **THEN** the Designer answers, not Intake

#### Scenario: Compose request in a new thread
- **WHEN** a thread has no piece and no brief, its confirmed room is `Wohnen`, the house file holds an approved version of `bench` in `Wohnen`, and the owner asks to compose `Wohnen` with it
- **THEN** the Designer answers, not Intake

#### Scenario: Empty room compose request in a new thread
- **WHEN** a thread has no piece and no brief, its confirmed room is `Hall`, nothing is approved and nothing is composed, and the owner asks to compose `Hall` with no furniture
- **THEN** the Designer answers, not Intake

#### Scenario: Revise a named piece from a new thread
- **WHEN** a thread has no piece and no brief, its confirmed room is `Schlafzimmer`, the Designer's last reply named `murphy-bed` (in `Schlafzimmer`), and the owner answers "Revise it"
- **THEN** the Designer answers, not Intake, and `murphy-bed` is the conversation's active build

#### Scenario: No piece named
- **WHEN** a thread has a confirmed room, no piece and no brief, and the owner writes "revise it" without any reply or message naming a piece in the house file
- **THEN** Intake answers

#### Scenario: Two builds named
- **WHEN** a conversation's builds are `shoe-rack` and `shoe-bench` and the owner writes "make the shoe one wider"
- **THEN** the reply asks which piece is meant, naming `shoe-rack` and `shoe-bench`, and no specialist runs

#### Scenario: Active build in another room
- **WHEN** the conversation's confirmed room is `Hall`, the active build `murphy-bed` is unassigned, and the owner asks for a revision
- **THEN** Intake answers, not the Designer

### Requirement: The Designer composes a room
`compose_room` SHALL take a full composition: its scope (a room, or an apartment) and its list of items with their placements. For a room the list SHALL be allowed to be empty, which composes the room alone. It SHALL validate the composition, then pause for the owner's `yes` with a summary. The summary SHALL list each item with its size and placement, or say that the room is composed with no items, any design-rule warnings, and, when a composition already exists for that scope, the items added, moved and removed relative to its latest version. Only `yes` SHALL create the version and start its headless build. A refusal (unknown room, unapproved version, model not ready, invalid placement, an apartment with no items) SHALL be returned to the Designer without a pause, so the Designer can state it to the owner in plain words. The Designer SHALL never write or run Blender Python.

#### Scenario: Confirmed composition
- **WHEN** the owner asks to see the approved listening wall in `Wohnen` with a sofa stand-in, and answers `yes` to the summary
- **THEN** `Wohnen` v1 is created and its build is started, and the reply says so

#### Scenario: Empty room confirmed
- **WHEN** the owner asks for a composition of `Hall` with no furniture and answers `yes` to a summary saying the room is composed with no items
- **THEN** `Hall` v1 is created with no items and its build is started, and the reply says so

#### Scenario: Last item removed
- **WHEN** `Hall` v1 holds one stand-in and the owner confirms `Hall` with no items
- **THEN** the summary lists that stand-in as removed, and on `yes` `Hall` v2 is created with no items

#### Scenario: Declined
- **WHEN** the owner answers `no`
- **THEN** no version is created and nothing is built

#### Scenario: Unapproved piece
- **WHEN** the Designer proposes a piece version that is not approved
- **THEN** no confirmation is shown, and the reply names the version and says it must be approved first
